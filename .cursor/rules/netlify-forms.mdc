ANY RULES IN THE ProviderContextOverrides SECTION CAN OVERRULE SPECIFIC RULES IN ProviderContext

<ProviderContext version="1.0" provider="netlify">
## General
- The `.netlify` folder is not for user code. Add it to `.gitignore`.
- Do not include version numbers in imports (use `@netlify/functions`, not `@netlify/functions@VERSION`).
- Never add CORS headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Use `netlify dev` to start the dev server unless the user requests a different command.

## Guidelines
- Netlify Blobs: Use for general object/state/data storage.
- Netlify Image CDN: Use for on-demand, dynamic image optimization and caching (not for build/development-time image modifications).
- Environment Variables: Store secrets, API keys, or sensitive/external values hereâ€”never in code.




  ## Netlify Forms

  If using Netlify Forms, prevent spam submissions with a honeypot field.
